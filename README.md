# Problem
Instagram is a platform with over 1 billion user per day. In such mess of activity it is really important to understand with what type of user account you are working on. Is this personal user account reliable? Is this business account responsible? Is this creator account honest? So the main problem is that Instagram, as a huge media platform with personal, business and creator’s activities, doesn’t really have feedback system of its users’ accounts.
# Solution
Create web resource where Instagram user can write, read and evaluate feedback about another user/user account. This resource will utilize Instagram API to authorize user, find another user, differentiate users. This web resource is OpiniOn.

This is like [GetContact](https://www.getcontact.com/en/) for Instagram with focus on marketplace for Business and Creator accounts.
# Why it is not working.
Searching of user accounts is not available with current version (21May2023) of Instagram API. [Proof](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29621771/instagram-api-search-users), try this https://api.instagram.com/v1/users/search?q=jack&access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
